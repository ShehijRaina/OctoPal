# BotSpotter ðŸ¤–

A simple browser extension that helps identify potential bots and misinformation on Twitter/X.

## Features

- **Bot Detection**: Analyze Twitter accounts for potential bot-like behavior
- **Misinformation Flagging**: Check posts for potential misleading content

## How It Works

This extension uses simple heuristics to estimate the likelihood that a Twitter account is a bot or if content might be misinformation:

### Bot Detection Signals
- Username patterns (random characters, lots of numbers)
- Verification status
- Posting frequency patterns

### Misinformation Signals
- Excessive capitalization
- Overuse of exclamation marks
- Keywords often associated with false content
- Excessive hashtag usage
